====== RPM Package Preparation ======
Updated Friday 21 February 2025

1. Download the latest source tarball. This can be:-
	a. Either the tarball from a debuild
	b. Or a source tarball from a git repo
2. Create / update the <package-name>.spec.in file.
	a. Ensure version and release fields are updated.
		1. If the release is a normal release
			a. The version will have the format vx.x.x as in the tarball
		2. If the release is a development rc release
			a. If the source tarball is a release candidate from a git repo it will be vx.x.x-rcx, osc will translate this to vx.x.x~rcx
			b. Or a debuild will already have the vx.x.x~rcx format.
3. Delete old sources.
4. Add / remove files within osc.
	a. osc ar
5. Update the osc ChangeLog.
	a. osc vc
6. Build the package locally. e.g.
	a. osc-build-local-package.sh
	b. osc-build-local-package.sh Fedora_29
		1. Will build Fedora 29.
		2. N.B. Regular key problems means you may have to supply the --no-verify option.
