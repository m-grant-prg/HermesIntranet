====== Kernel Build Guide. ======
Created Monday 21 February 2022

To avoid setting up the entire config file by hand it is easiest to use your distributionâ€™s config file as a starting point. This step can be re-run when a new distribution kernel is installed.
		   When building based on a new config file key kernel modules must be loaded, things like CD drivers. So,
1. To build a kernel with a new config file.
	a. Insert and open a CD such as the VirtualBox Guest Additions.
	b. Attach any NAS needed.
	c. kern-bld.sh -nipc /boot/config-4.4.0-36-generic -s /home/mgrantprg/SWDev/kernel/source -o /home/mgrantprg/SWDev/kernel/build linux-stable
	d. As the install option has been specified, you will be prompted for your sudo password prior to installation.
2. To build a kernel with an exiting config file.
	a. kern-bld.sh -uipc /boot/config-4.4.0-36-generic -s /home/mgrantprg/SWDev/kernel/source -o /home/mgrantprg/SWDev/kernel/build linux-stable
	b. As the install option has been specified, you will be prompted for your sudo password prior to installation.
3. At the time of writing there is a dependency failure on Debian which leads to the crc32c_generic module not being included in initrd. To persistently avoid this problem add the module to the initrd modules file.
	a. sudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
	b. Append the line:-
		1. crc32c_generic
4. Reboot into the new kernel.
5. If this is a VirtualBox Guest system then re-install the Guest Additions.
6. Cleanup the old kernel.
	a. Remove the old initramfs
		1. sudo update-initramfs -dk 4.7.1
	b. Remove the old kernel modules
		1. sudo rm -vr /lib/modules/4.7.1
	c. Remove the old kernel files
		1. sudo rm -v /boot/*4.7.1*
	d. sudo update-grub
